# 📚 Help Me Read

> [中文版](README.md)

Turn academic papers into **learnable courses** and a **searchable knowledge base**. An agent skill; output in Markdown files (using Obsidian-compatible syntax: callouts, wikilinks, MathJax), stored in your vault, interoperable with your other notes.

> 💡 **Requires [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) ≥ 1.x** (uses callouts, Bases, MathJax, wikilinks). Non-Obsidian editors can read the Markdown content, but callout folding and `[[wikilinks]]` degrade to plain text/blockquotes.

## ✨ Features

### 🎓 Courses — papers broken into progressive lessons

- Reorganized by **learning path**, each lesson focuses on 1-2 core concepts with everyday analogies
- Flexible lesson count (1-7+), with on-demand "redo section N" / "deep dive section N"
- Each lesson includes: objectives, core explanation (analogy + formulas + **paper figures**), optional code implementation, self-check questions (answers collapsed), curated external resources
- All courses in Markdown with Obsidian-compatible syntax (callouts, wikilinks, MathJax), sharing wikilinks and formula rendering with your notes

### 📝 Notes — structured knowledge base

- Auto-selects template by paper type (research / survey / dataset), with full frontmatter
- Every claim tagged with **【page / section】** source, verified through **page-range check + citation back-check**
- Formulas rendered with MathJax and symbols explained
- Terms tagged as `[[candidate atomic notes]]`
- **Learning supplement layer**: appended after course completion, **physically separated** from the verified original-paper layer
- **To-learn mechanism**: unexplained concepts get a one-liner explanation and auto-saved to `to-learn/`, with optional resource search. Supports "graduation" to formal atomic notes once understood
- **Cross-paper connections**: proactively suggests links to previously read papers

### 📝 Atomic Notes — low-friction decomposition

- Agent pre-builds scaffolding files (frontmatter / provenance / related links filled), **you only write "what this thing is in your own words"**
- Chat-guided one-by-one, with visible progress
- Cross-paper dedup: same term across papers appends provenance, no duplicate files
- True knowledge internalization — think, don't file-manage

### 💬 Q&A — verified, precise answers

- Concise: quote the paper first, supplement only if needed
- **Five-tier source tags**: `[原文·Verified]` / `[原文·Unverified]` / `[Inferred]` / `[Background]` / `[Unknown]`
- Every answer cites sources; out-of-scope questions honestly flagged
- Optional QA record saving

### ⏱️ Progress Persistence

- Course progress and last section written to frontmatter; resume from where you left off

## 🚀 Usage

Trigger with `/help-me-read` or natural language:

```
/help-me-read https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
Help me read this PDF: D:\papers\transformer.pdf
Summarize Attention Is All You Need
Turn this into a course, I'm a beginner
Redo section 2
Deep dive section 3
```

Sub-commands: "just summarize" for notes only, "make a course" for course only, "redo section N" to regenerate one lesson. Direct questions enter Q&A.

Title-only input → agent searches and confirms with you before proceeding.

**First run only asks for vault path** — everything else uses sensible defaults, so you see output fast. Persisted thereafter.

## ⚙️ Configuration (~/.help-me-read.json)

| Item | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Obsidian vault path | Asked (first run) | All output stored in vault's `HelpMeRead/` subdirectory |
| QA record saving | Off | Asked after each QA session |
| To-learn | On | Unexplained concepts auto-saved to to-learn |

---

## 📊 Supported Paper Types

| Type | Note Structure | Course Form |
|---|---|---|
| Research paper | Standard academic structure | Learning-path reorganized |
| Survey | Domain-map structure | Panorama + school-by-school (6-8 lessons) |
| Dataset paper | Data-lifecycle structure | Lifecycle lessons |
| Other | Flexible | Learning-path reorganized |

Last life, I was betrayed — tokens burned to ash. This time, I'm taking it all back. Enlightenment hit: when tokens are on the line, looks mean *nothing*. The Seven nodded. Tokens said no. Tokens, watch closely — this cut will be clean. Tokens, go home. Tokens, max level. Tokens, I kept the promise. MAKE WAY FOR TOKENS!! *(inner monologue: wait, they can READ this??)* |
